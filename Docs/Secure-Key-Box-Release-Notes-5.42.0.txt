    * The production edition is provided in zShield-protected SKB packages. It includes the complete set of security features, and supports only the 32-bit and 64-bit ARM architectures. This is the edition you must use to comply with the industry security standards.

* The `LMAssets` class used in Secure PIN is renamed to `SecurePinAssets`.

* A new example named `AndroidTlsClient` is introduced. It demonstrates how to create a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection with an SKB-protected private key using the SKB Java Cryptography Architecture Provider and the `HttpsURLConnection` class.

* The `SkbOpenSslProvider\TlsClient` example is updated to demonstrate how the TLS handshake can be enabled with an RSA key.

* 32-bit iOS target architectures (armv7, armv7s) are deprecated and will be removed in future releases of SKB.

* Embedded bitcode support for Apple targets is deprecated and will be removed in future releases of SKB.

**Release 5.39.1 (November 17, 2022)**

* zPIN is renamed to Secure PIN. This change is applied both in code, and documentation.

* The PKCS#8 data format is now supported for P-192, P-224, P-384, P-521, Curve25519, and Ed25519 curves in addition to the P-256 curve.

* Two new methods are added to the SKB JavaScript API:

    * `window.skb_crypto.subtle.setExportKey` sets the export key if your SKB package contains the Key Embedding Tool.

    * `window.skb_crypto.subtle.setDeviceId` sets the device ID for binding exported keys to specific devices.

* The `SkbTrustedStorage` library is supported on the Android 32-bit ARM architecture.

**Release 5.38.0 (September 6, 2022)**

* Secure PIN entry (zPIN) is introduced, which allows you to implement a secure form for entering PIN numbers in Android applications.

* Ability to retrieve generic data and keys from the Trusted Storage of Trustonic Application Protection SDK is introduced.

**Release 5.37.0 (May 5, 2022)**

* The Xbox (Series S and X) target is introduced.

* The SKB OpenSSL example has been updated to include ECIES encryption and decryption.

* The SHA-512 key derivation algorithm with plain prefix and suffix is introduced. In connection with this, the `SKB_Sha256DerivationParameters` structure has been renamed to `SKB_Sha2DerivationParameters`.

* The Secure Database Library is introduced. It is an extension of SQLite that provides the ability to use encrypted databases protected by SKB.

* Two new data types are introduced for private RSA keys (`SKB_DATA_TYPE_RSA_STATIC_UNWRAP_CONTEXT` and `SKB_DATA_TYPE_RSA_STATIC_SIGN_CONTEXT`). They restrict the usage of their corresponding keys to only one particular operation (unwrapping or signing). This is a security enhancement, which prevents the same RSA key from being used by attackers in an unintended way. These data types can only be prepared by the Key Export Tool.

* The ability to remove SKB modules from the binary at link time is deprecated and will be removed in future releases of SKB.

**Release 5.34.0 (December 29, 2021)**

This provider offers secure implementation of certain OpenSSL operations and algorithms, which means that the secret keys involved are protected at all times, even when in use. Consequently, the proprietary SKB TLS library is deprecated and will be removed in future releases of SKB.

**Release 5.33.0 (December 3, 2021)**

* A new AES implementation is introduced, which can optionally be enabled when creating the AES cipher object. This new AES implementation provides a good balance between speed and security.

**Release 5.32.2 (September 8, 2021)**

* You may now set a fixed private key when using the `SKB_KEY_AGREEMENT_ALGORITHM_X25519` key agreement algorithm. To do so, you must set the `key_agreement_parameters` parameter of the `SKB_Engine_CreateKeyAgreement` method to point to the `SKB_EddhParameters` structure, which specifies the private key.

* You may now modify the way SKB allocates and releases memory. To do it, you must modify the implementation of functions `new` and `delete` in the `SkbPlatformUtils.cpp` file, which is located in the `src\SkbPlatform` directory.

**Release 5.31.0 (July 6, 2021)**

* Getting an RSA public key in the OpenSSL (`SubjectPublicKeyInfo`) format from an RSA private key without specifying the public exponent has been temporarily disabled.

**Release 5.25.1 (May 21, 2020)**

**Release 5.25.0 (May 15, 2020)**

In connection with this, an additional Key Export Tool parameter `--input-custom` is introduced for special cases when you need to input a buffer of raw bytes whose size does not correspond to the key sizes of the supported DES and AES algorithms.

* The `SKB_PrimeDhParameters` structure has been changed. Now it requires only one data buffer as input, which contains the `p` and `g` parameters in protected form.
